# Intelligent-Fire-Protection-System
 The transformation that is happening in the building industry with the advancing in electronics, techs information communications and sensors. Many technologies that are new have emerged. The cost of operation is being significantly lowered while performance is improved thanks to digitalization. The extensive use of materials and technologies in buildings, the risk that fire causes to property and life is increasing. Many new fire detection and sensing technologies has been developed in recent years thanks to this. The priority of making of intelligent systems and buildings worldwide has been made high. The building of intelligence is equipped with info, instrumentation and communication technology that includes lights, smoke detection, monitoring of surroundings, management of power, building health management, cooling and heating, gas and water management, ventilation, and many more. Safety of human life is the primary issue and should be prioritized over properties from man-made disasters like fires. The international association of fire and rescue services (CTIF) reported approximately 16,190 casualties due to fire hazard in the United States, from 2012 to 2016. The ratio is very high in comparison to other reasons of casualty.
